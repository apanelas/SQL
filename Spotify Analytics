#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#What is the danceability of the ten most popular tracks?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#What is the average tempo of the tracks and the average duration in minutes?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(tempo), 2) AS average_tempo, ROUND(AVG (duration_ms)/60000, 2) AS average_duration_minutes FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#What is the average danceability of songs with a popularity score of at least 92?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 92;

#Identify the artists whose songs appear most frequently on the list and rank them in order of frequency
SELECT distinct artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS frequency
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

#I used a CTE to denote which artists had an average popularity of 90 or more across all their tracks on the list and tagged them as "Top Star"s 
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC;
